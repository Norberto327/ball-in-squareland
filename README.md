# ball-in-squareland
An open-source platformer game

Ball in squareland is a platformer with RPG elements written in python 3.9 using the pygame library. 
The game is currently in the alpha stage (alpha v3), which includes basic physics and multiple screens of collidable geometry.

For linux, you'll have to download python (3.7 and above should work, tested to 3.8 and above) and the pygame library with:
pip install pygame
