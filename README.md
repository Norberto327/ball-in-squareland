# ball-in-squareland
An open-source platformer game

Ball in squareland is a platformer with RPG elements written in python 3.9 using the pygame library. 
The game is currently in the alpha stage (alpha v2), which includes basic physics and collidable geometry.

To run on Windows, the .exe file should work.

For linux, you'll have to download python (3.7 and above should work, tested to 3.8 and above) and the pygame library with:
pip install pygame
